# Sign-Up Form

This project showcases a sign-up form with a simple CSS animation. The form is designed with a dark theme, purple subtones, and transparent input fields with rounded corners. JavaScript is used to validate the password and ensure that the passwords match. Assignment was given by [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch)

## Features

- **Gradient Animation:** The left 1/3 of the screen features a CSS animation with a seamless gradient.

- **Form Layout:** The right 2/3 of the screen contains a sign-up form with form fields grouped into three rows.

- **Password Validation:** JavaScript is used to confirm that the "confirm password" matches the "password." If not, a prompt is shown, and incorrect entries revert the boxes to empty.

- **Login Link:** Below the form, there's a link for users who already have an account to log in, directing them back to the same page.
